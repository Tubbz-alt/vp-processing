# To build the book, open src/vp-processing.Rproj and then src/index.Rmd in RStudio.
# Click the "Build > Build book" button in RStudio to build the book.
# While building, the following temp file will be created:
book_filename: vp-processing.Rmd

# The output will be generated in the docs directory:
output_dir: ../docs

# Remove the Rmd file created in the build process:
delete_merged_file: true

# The order of the chapters (and which Rmd files to include) is defined here:
rmd_files: [index.Rmd, setup.Rmd, extract_vp.Rmd, vp_to_flowviz.Rmd]

# All other settings are defined in /src/index.Rmd
