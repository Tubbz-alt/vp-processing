# Preface {-}

This document describes how we process **vertical profile (vp) data**[^1] for further analysis and visualizations such as the [bird migration flow visualization](http://enram.github.io/bird-migration-flow-visualization/viz/).

[^1]: Vertical profiles of birds generated from weather radar volume scans by [vol2bird](https://github.com/adokter/vol2bird).
