# Introduction {-}

This tutorial describes how to process **vertical profile (vp) data**[^1] for visualizations, such as [TIMAMP](http://timamp.github.io/) or the [bird migration flow visualization](http://enram.github.io/bird-migration-flow-visualization/viz/). You can also use it to just download or extract vp data for further analysis.

[^1]: Bird migration data generated from weather radar data.
